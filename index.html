		<p><em>Junior Software Engineer</em></p>
		<p>
			My name is Todd, and I am making a midlife career change to Software
			Engineering.

			</p>
			<p>
			<em> "But aren't you too old to change careers and learn to
				code?"</em> I hear you ask. Wait, let me turn the hearing aid up.  Okay, go ahead and ask again....</p>
            <p><strong>NO!</strong></p>
            <p>I mean, 50 is the new 30, or so I am told. </p>
            <p>Someone needs to tell my body. It didn't get the memo.</p>
		</p>
		<p>
			At any rate, I finally realized in my late 40's that I really enjoy
			coding. The experience of creating something out of nothing and
			getting the computer to do (mostly!) what I want it to do intrigues
			me. I am looking forward to having finally found what I want to do.
			Like Baz Luhrmann says in
			<em>"Everybody's Free To Wear Sunscreen"</em>, "Don't feel guilty if
			you don't know what you want to do with your life. The most
			interesting people I know didn't know at 22 what they wanted to do
			with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know
			still don't."
		</p>
		<p>
			In my downtime, I enjoy spending time with my wife and son. I have
			built a gaming PC complete with sim racing rig, and thouroughly
			enjoy realizing that I am ok with being a cautious driver on the
			real streets! <p>*Adds <em>Must practice sim racing more</em> to Todo
